Howdy!
This shortcut “rate limits” how many times you can open an app. Once you set this shortcut up, create an automation for the app(s) you want to rate limit and call this shortcut!

This shortcut requires Data Jar to be installed. Install it; create a new list with a name; forget about it.

You’ll be asked for the name of the store in Data Jar, that’s the name of the list.

You’ll be asked for the number of times you can open the app until it’s blocked and the cooldown time (in minutes).

Enjoy!
