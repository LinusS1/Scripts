# Scripts
A collection of the AppleScripts I use

I use FastScripts to run these scripts, though you can use the global script menu along with [individual application script menus](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803572/#add-scripts-to-your-menu-bar). Have fun with these; take a look before trying to run them because a lot of them rely on my personal set up ðŸ™ƒ
